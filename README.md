# CS5431

Maven

### Assume that you have maven and mysql database running, make sure all dependencies in pom.xml are imported

##How to run this system###
    (From Terminal)
    0) Build the project
    1) run ServerSetup (under src/org/cs5431_server/setup/)
    2) Follow the prompts to create your database and certificate
    3) Run ServerView to run as admin
    4) Run Client
    5) client to set up truststore password
    6) client to accept cert and store it
    7) client to disconnect
    8) rerun client
    9) connect client to the server that has been set up (and should still be running at this point)

We plan to host the server on a web service in the future, but as of now, we are testing the role of server and client
on multiple laptops as of now.
