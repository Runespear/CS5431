# CS5431

Maven

### Assume that you have maven and mysql database running, make sure all dependencies in pom.xml are imported

(Move the pom.xml outside of the src folder)

## How to run this system on localhost for now, please use an IDE like IntelliJ or something for now to run this ###
(From Terminal)

0. Make sure MySQL is setup and running
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install mysql
  ```
  *To run mysql, just:
  ```sh
  mysql -u root -p
  ```
  *You will be prompted for your root password. TYPE IT IN.
  *Remember what your root password is!
  Also, make sure to import all the dependencies based off the pom.xml (We are using maven)
  A quick and dirty way to do this is to cut away a line from the pom.xml and paste it back. 
  The IDE will automatically download the dependencies for yous

# Server Side
1. Run ServerSetup (under src/org/cs5431_server/setup/)
  * i.e. invoke in the correct directory using the IDE run button
  * There ought to be a main function under ServerSetup.java 
  * The whole thing is a main function actually 

2. Follow the prompts to create your database and certificate
  * For IP address type "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost"
  * When prompted for your MySQL username and password, just use your root account's for now
  * i.e. username for root is "root"
  * password for MySQL is your root password
  * The default port for MySQL is 3306
  * Use any other port number above 1024 for the other 2 ports
  * When prompted to generate your keystore password, use something simple for now like "qweqweqweqweqweqwe"
  * Cycle through the details. When prompted:
  ```sh
  Is CN=whatever, OU=whatever, O=whatever, L=whatever, ST=whatever, C=whatever correct?
  ```
  * Just type in "yes"
  * Next, when prompted as such:
  ```sh
  Enter key password for <mykey>
    (RETURN if same as keystore password):  
  ```
  * Just hit enter.
  * You will be asked to re-enter your keystore password 
  * Now Under ./server-config/, notice that you now have .cer, .jks, .priv, .config files
  * Also, under ./user-config/ we now have a .config and a .pub file (Public Key for the keytransport)
  * As per instructed, we are to distribute this to our users
3. Typically we will email them or something, but in this case, since we are running in localhost for now
   we don't have to do anything

4. Run ServerView to run as admin
  * Follow exactly what the prompts tell you to do
  * After entering your keystore password, there are no more prompts for now, since the server is setup
  * Now we run the client side

# Client Side

5. Run Client
  * This is located under ./src/org/cs5431_client/view/Client.java
  * Notice a fancy GUI popup
  * In the dropdown, select the entry, which should be the name of the server
  * Now go back to the command line
  * Follow the prompt to enter the password for the keystore
  * If you were obedient it would be "qweqweqwewqeqweqwe"
6. Client to set up truststore password
  * Choose something simple
  * Like "qwewqeqweqweqweqwe"
7. Client to accept cert and store it
  * Type yes (Typing no will result in a permanent loss of trust for that server's certificate, which is not recommended)
8. Connect client to the server that has been set up (and should still be running at this point)

We plan to host the server on a web service in the future, but as of now, we are testing the role of server and client
on multiple laptops as of now.
